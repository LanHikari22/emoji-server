Welcome to the Emoji Server! Hosted by Lan and Farawla. Here, you can find
pictures of various characters from video games and animes showing different
facial expressions, intended as more entertaining replacements for actual 
emojis. If you have any ideas for new emojis to add to the server, and you know
either Lan or Farawla personally, you can contact either of them. You just
might see your emojis posted here.

This server can be easily copied to your local system using a Git repository,
located at:

Alternatively, the server can be mounted or mapped using the web address:
